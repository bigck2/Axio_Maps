I asked when were their original move ins for the first buildings & she said there are 12 TH`s that opened about 5 yrs ago & are all unavailable. The FB page also said FMI would be in March, but it seems as if that was the second building she referred to & that it was pushed back to June. Could not confirm total # of units b/c the mgr was not sure yet, she said ""she had a meeting soon & they would be letting her know exactly how many."" She said she thought there would be around 400, but our notes says 158 planned. I will leave the 158 planned (straight line) since she was not positive.
